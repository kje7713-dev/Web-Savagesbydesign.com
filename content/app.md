<h1>The Savage by Design App</h1>

<p class="subhead"><strong>Track what you do. Do it consistently. Watch what happens.</strong></p>

<h2>For People Who Actually Move</h2>

<p>Most fitness apps are built for people who <em>think about</em> fitness. We built this for people who <em>do the thing</em>.</p>

<p>Whether you're lifting heavy, rolling on mats, hiking mountains, rowing until your lungs burn, or just trying to show up to your Tuesday night basketball league — this app gets out of your way and tracks what matters.</p>

<p>No badges. No social feed. No "motivation." Just you, your activity, and the data that helps you keep showing up.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<h3>Structure Your Efforts</h3>
<p>Give your activity some shape. Running a 12-week strength program? Training for a backpacking trip? Prepping for a BJJ tournament? The app lets you organize your work into purposeful blocks.</p>

<p>Or don't. Log individual sessions. Track your Tuesday pickup games. The app bends to fit your life — not the other way around.</p>

<h3>Track What You Actually Do</h3>
<p>Capture the details that matter to you. Sets, reps, distance, time, how you felt, what worked, what hurt.</p>

<p>The app doesn't care if you're hitting a new deadlift PR or just managed to drag yourself to the trail after a brutal work week. It tracks the effort either way.</p>

<h3>Review and Improve</h3>
<p>Look back. See patterns. Notice what's working. Adjust what isn't.</p>

<p>No algorithm telling you what to do. Just clear data that helps you make better decisions about your training.</p>

<h2>Who Uses This</h2>

<p>This app is for anyone who moves their body with some intention:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lifters</strong> — Track progressive overload, manage training cycles, know your numbers</li>
<li><strong>Combat athletes</strong> — Log mat time, strength work, and conditioning in one place</li>
<li><strong>Endurance folks</strong> — Runners, cyclists, rowers who want structure without overkill</li>
<li><strong>Outdoor people</strong> — Hikers, climbers, paddlers building consistent activity habits</li>
<li><strong>Community sports players</strong> — Track your pickup games, leagues, and supplemental training</li>
<li><strong>Masters athletes</strong> — Anyone training smart while managing real life (work, family, aging bodies)</li>
<li><strong>Regular humans</strong> — People who just want to get off their ass consistently and track it honestly</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do something physical repeatedly and want to track it without the circus — this app works for you.</p>

<h2>What It Does</h2>

<h3>Flexible Activity Tracking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Log any type of physical activity — strength, conditioning, sport, outdoor adventure</li>
<li>Track the details that matter to your specific activity</li>

</ul>

<h3>Built for Real Life</h3>

<li>Quick entry when you're sweaty and tired</li>
<li>Flexible enough for structured programs or casual activity</li>
<li>Works whether you train 6 days a week or squeeze in what you can</li>
<li>No social pressure, no streaks, no gamification nonsense</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data That Helps</h3>
<ul>
<li>See your progression over time</li>
<li>Identify patterns in your training</li>
<li>Make informed decisions about what to do next</li>
<li>Export your data — it's yours</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Point</h2>

<p>You become what you repeatedly do. Not what you plan to do. Not what you post about doing. What you <em>actually</em> do.</p>

<p>This app helps you track the doing. It doesn't motivate you. It doesn't coach you. It doesn't pretend to be your friend.</p>

<p>It just shows you the truth: Did you show up? How often? What changed?</p>

<p>The rest is on you.</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p><strong>The app is currently in development.</strong> We're building it for people who value consistency over hype.</p>
