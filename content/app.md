  <h1>Savages By Design App</h1>
  <p><strong>Track what you do. Do it consistently. Watch what happens.</strong></p>
  <p>The Savages By Design app is built for people who actually move. Not people chasing badges, streaks, or motivation quotes — people who show up and do the work.</p>

  <h2>What this app is for</h2>
  <p>Most fitness apps are designed for people who think about training. This one is for people who train.</p>
  <p>Whether you lift, grapple, run, row, hike, play pickup sports, or just try to stay consistent through real life — this app tracks what matters without getting in your way.</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <h3>Structure your work</h3>
  <p>Organize your training into blocks when you want structure, or log individual sessions when life gets messy. The app adapts to how you train — not the other way around.</p>

  <h3>Track what you actually did</h3>
  <p>Log sets, reps, time, distance, notes, and effort. No judgment, no gamification, no artificial pressure.</p>

  <h3>Review and adjust</h3>
  <p>Look back at your history, spot patterns, and make smarter decisions about what to keep and what to change.</p>

  <h2>Who it’s for</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lifters</strong> tracking progression and training cycles</li>
    <li><strong>Combat athletes</strong> managing mat time and supplemental work</li>
    <li><strong>Endurance athletes</strong> who want structure without complexity</li>
    <li><strong>Outdoor athletes</strong> building capacity over time</li>
    <li><strong>Masters athletes</strong> balancing training with work, family, and recovery</li>
    <li><strong>Regular humans</strong> trying to show up more often than they skip</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The point</h2>
  <p>You don’t become better because of what you plan to do. You become better because of what you repeatedly do.</p>
  <p>This app doesn’t coach you or motivate you. It shows you the truth: did you show up, how often, and what changed.</p>
  <p>The rest is on you.</p>
