<h1>The Savage by Design App</h1>

<p class="subhead"><strong>A workout tracking system built for athletes who think. Not another generic fitness tracker.</strong></p>

<h2>Built for Serious Training</h2>

<p>Most workout apps treat your training like a diary. Random notes. Loose logs. No structure.</p>

<p>The Savage by Design App treats training blocks, sessions, and progression as <strong>first-class objects</strong> — not afterthoughts.</p>

<p>If you're a grappler running a strength block, a lifter tracking progressive overload, or a masters athlete managing volume and recovery — this is your system.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<h3>Training Blocks</h3>
<p>Structure your work into purposeful blocks. Strength cycles. Conditioning phases. Competition prep. Each block has a goal, a timeline, and clear progression.</p>

<p>No random workouts. Every session earns its place in the block.</p>

<h3>Session Execution</h3>
<p>Execute your training with clarity. Track sets, reps, weight, time, and effort. See your progression within the block. Know what's next.</p>

<p>Built for athletes who want to know <em>why</em> they're doing a session, not just log that they did it.</p>

<h3>Data Capture & Review</h3>
<p>Track your work. Review your blocks. See what worked. Iterate on what didn't.</p>

<p>The app captures training data in a way that supports analysis and planning — not just vanity metrics.</p>

<h2>Who It's For</h2>

<p>This app is built for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combat athletes</strong> — BJJ competitors and grapplers who need structured S&C to support their sport</li>
<li><strong>Strength athletes</strong> — Powerlifters and lifters running progressive programs</li>
<li><strong>Masters athletes</strong> — Training smart with longevity and recovery in mind</li>
<li><strong>Systems thinkers</strong> — Athletes who track, review, and iterate on their training</li>
</ul>

<p>If you treat training like engineering, not entertainment — this is your tool.</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>The Savage by Design App embodies our core beliefs:</p>

<p><strong>Systems Over Motivation</strong> — You don't log workouts because you "feel motivated." You execute your block because it's the system.</p>

<p><strong>Intent Over Accident</strong> — Every session has a purpose. The app helps you maintain that intent across weeks and months.</p>

<p><strong>Respect for the Athlete</strong> — We assume you're intelligent. You want to track, review, and improve — not just collect workout badges.</p>

<h2>Not for Everyone</h2>

<p>This app is <strong>not</strong> for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casual gym-goers looking for a simple log</li>
<li>Athletes who don't want structure</li>
<li>People who train randomly and call it "intuitive"</li>
<li>Anyone looking for a social fitness platform</li>
</ul>

<p>It's for athletes who train with intent. Who value systems. Who want their tools to match the seriousness of their work.</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p><strong>The app is currently in development.</strong> Built for athletes who refuse to compromise on training quality.</p>
