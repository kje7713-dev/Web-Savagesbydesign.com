<h1>About Savage by Design</h1>

<p><strong>Elite outcomes are engineered, not accidental.</strong></p>

<p>Savage by Design is a performance-first training and lifestyle brand built for athletes who train with intent. We blend strength, conditioning, combat sports, and disciplined systems thinking into programs, tools, and products designed for serious athletes who refuse to leave results to chance.</p>

<h2>Who We Serve</h2>

<p>We build for serious recreational athletes — especially those balancing high-level goals with real-world constraints. Age. Work. Family. Recovery. You train hard, but you train smart. You're not chasing Instagram aesthetics. You're engineering performance.</p>

<p>Our athletes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grapplers and combat athletes</strong> — BJJ competitors, masters grapplers, anyone who needs strength and conditioning to support their sport</li>
<li><strong>Lifters who think</strong> — Powerlifters and strength athletes who value structure and progression</li>
<li><strong>Masters athletes</strong> — Training with longevity and joint health in mind, not reckless volume</li>
<li><strong>Systems thinkers</strong> — Athletes who track, review, iterate, and understand the "why" behind their training</li>
</ul>

<h2>What We Believe</h2>

<h3>Training With Intent</h3>
<p>Every program we build is purpose-driven. No filler. No random workouts. Every session earns its place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength (powerlifting & barbell fundamentals)</li>
<li>Conditioning (rower-based, engine development, work capacity)</li>
<li>Combat sports performance (especially Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu)</li>
<li>Longevity-aware progression (masters athletes, joint health, sustainability)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Systems Over Motivation</h3>
<p>You don't "feel motivated" — you execute the system. We emphasize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured training blocks</li>
<li>Clear progression models</li>
<li>Decision-driven training (not vibes)</li>
<li>Data capture and review</li>
</ul>

<h3>Built for the Thinking Athlete</h3>
<p>We respect your intelligence. Our approach attracts athletes who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to understand why they train a certain way</li>
<li>Value tracking, review, and iteration</li>
<li>Prefer frameworks over hype</li>
<li>See training as engineering, not entertainment</li>
</ul>

<h2>What We Build</h2>

<p><strong>Savage by Design Training</strong> — Structured strength and conditioning programs. No gimmicks. No random WODs. Just intelligent, progressive training designed for results.</p>

<p><strong>Savage by Design App</strong> — A purpose-built workout tracking and execution system. Training blocks, sessions, and progression treated as first-class objects — not loose notes in a generic tracker.</p>

<p><strong>Combat-Adjacent Performance</strong> — Strong crossover with BJJ, grappling, and competition prep. Built by athletes who understand what it takes on the mats and in the gym.</p>

<h2>Our Voice</h2>

<p>Direct. Disciplined. Zero fluff. We respect the athlete's intelligence.</p>

<p>Not motivational. Not cute. Professional and hard-edged. We don't sell hype. We build systems that work.</p>

<h2>One Line</h2>
