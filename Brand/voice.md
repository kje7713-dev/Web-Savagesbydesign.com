# Brand Voice — Savages By Design

## Vibe
Dark, aggressive, minimalist, “rock band / fight team” energy.
High-contrast. Short lines. No fluff.

## Audience
Lifters + grapplers. People who track training, recover hard, and care about performance.

## Writing rules
- Use short sentences. Punchy lines.
- Avoid corporate tone. Avoid “wellness” language.
- No hype you can’t prove. No miracle claims.
- Prefer concrete benefits over adjectives.
- Don’t over-explain. Let the reader feel it.

## Words to use
- Built. Forged. Earned. Sharp. Heavy. Grit. Discipline. Work. Pressure. Rounds. Sets.
- “Savages” as an in-group, but don’t overdo it.

## Words to avoid
- “Transform your life”
- “Guaranteed”
- “Best in the world”
- “Hack”
- “Biohacking”
- “Unleash your potential” (generic)

## CTAs
- “Get the app”
- “See the system”
- “Read the guide”
- “Grab the deal”
- “Contact us”

## Disclaimer tone (for training/AI)
Clear, calm, no drama:
- “Not medical advice.”
- “Use judgment.”
- “Train safe.”
