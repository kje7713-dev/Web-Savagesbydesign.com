## One-Paragraph About

Savage by Design is a performance-first training brand built for athletes who refuse to leave results to chance. We blend strength, conditioning, combat sports, and disciplined systems thinking into programs and tools designed for serious recreational athletes — especially those balancing high-level goals with real-world constraints like age, work, and family. We serve grapplers, lifters, and masters competitors who track their training, value progression, and understand the "why" behind their programming. No gimmicks. No hype. Just structured systems that earn results.

## Manifesto (Extended)

Elite outcomes are engineered, not accidental.

We reject fitness industry hype. No miracle claims. No transformation promises. No influencer theatrics.

We build for athletes who:
- Track their training and review their blocks
- Value structure over spontaneity  
- Want to understand the "why" behind their programming
- Train with constraints (age, recovery, time, competing demands)
- See training as engineering, not entertainment

We serve grapplers who need strength off the mats. Lifters who value clear progression. Masters athletes who train smart and hard. Systems thinkers who iterate and improve.

We emphasize:
- Structured training blocks with purpose
- Clear progression models
- Decision-driven training (not vibes)
- Data capture and review
- Sustainable, longevity-aware programming

You don't "feel motivated." You execute the system.

Train with intent. Not chance.
