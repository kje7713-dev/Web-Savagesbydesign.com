# Visual Direction — Savages By Design

- Dark background, high contrast
- Minimalist layout
- Bold headings
- Simple iconography
- Think: band poster meets fight team

Typography:
- Headlines: strong, condensed feel (if your theme supports it)
- Body: readable sans-serif

Imagery:
- Training shots, close-ups, chalk, mats, bars, grips
- Avoid stock-y smiling gym photos
